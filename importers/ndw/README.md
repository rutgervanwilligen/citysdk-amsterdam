# NDW importer

Adds data to existing NWB nodes in CitySDK on `ndw` layer, to be used by `ndw` webservice. This webservice uses real-time NDW data to link to NDW road segments in CitySDK upon request.

Importer expects NWB road segments to be already imported - see `nwb` importer.
Importer expects existing CitySDK layer `ndw`.

See `citysdk-ndw` repository for information about obtaining data, creating NDW database, and details about linking NDW DATEX II real-time traffic flow data to NWB road segments.
